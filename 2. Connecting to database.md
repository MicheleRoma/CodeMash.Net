Following lines describe two ways to connect to database.
```
var mongoUrl = new Driver.MongoUrl("mongodb://localhost/MyDatabaseName");
var repo = new MongoRepository<MyClass>(mongoUrl, "MyCollection");
```
```
string database_path = "mongodb://localhost/MyDatabaseName";
var repo = MongoRepositoryFactory.Create<MyClass>(database_path, "MyCollection");
```
If collection name is not given as parameter - collection name set by `MyClass` is used.  
If database name is not given by path or url parameters - default name "test" is used.  
Indicated databases and/or collection can be non existing - inserting new data will create them.  

C# object, which contains properties (including one for Id) correspond to MongoDB document. Meaning that we can save C# object as MongoDB document and read MongoDB document as C# object.  
The simplest way to include property for Id for your class is to inherit `Entity` class. Example of such class:
```
#!C#
[CollectionName("Projects")]
public class MyClass : Entity
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
```
Attribute is optional. If it is not set - class name `MyClass` is used as collection name.
